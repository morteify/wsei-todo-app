          They live their whole lives in water and have a lot of special qualities. Although they couldnâ€™t look more
          different than human beings, we have so much in common!

        <Paragraph>
          Whales are mammals just like we are. Just like us, they breathe air, have hair, are warm-blooded, give birth
          to live young, and feed their young milk. Whales are unique, beautiful, graceful and mysterious; they nurture,
          form friendships, innovate, grieve, play, sing and cooperate with one another. Here are some extraordinary
          facts about whales and their lives in the oceans.
