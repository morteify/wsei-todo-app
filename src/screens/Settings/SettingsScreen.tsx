        <Paragraph>
          Marco Polo was a Venetian explorer known for the book The Travels of Marco Polo, which describes his voyage to
          and experiences in Asia. Polo traveled extensively with his family, journeying from Europe to Asia from 1271
          to 1295 and remaining in China for 17 of those years. Around 1292, he left China, acting as consort along the
          way to a Mongol princess who was being sent to Persia.

        <Paragraph>
          Polo was born in 1254, in Venice, Italy. Although he was born to a wealthy Venetian merchant family, much of
          Poloâ€™s childhood was spent parentless, and he was raised by an extended family. Polo's mother died when he was
          young, and his father and uncle, successful jewel merchants Niccolo and Maffeo Polo, were in Asia for much of
          Polo's youth.
